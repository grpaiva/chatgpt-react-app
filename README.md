Let's create a react.js application for a portfolio. We'll add material-ui and Axios library. The homepage should have responsive design and responsive menu and responsive hamburger menu that works on mobile as well, it's important to use material-ui's native components. The homepage should have a hero section with markup text, right below the hero section a 4 columns section also with markup text, below that a newsletter signup form and a footer.
